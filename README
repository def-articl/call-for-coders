# call-for-coders

A Call for coders to work on a trans media artwork 


The project is A Social Network Portal 'Photzone' and  Media screen animation (frames)


The coding isn’t technically ground breaking and most the bulk of the coding is preset wordpress plugins. The call is for contributors for website scripting modification, social media API's, database integration, media screen animation. All contributors mentions, and on festival promotional material

The files include an abstract of the artwork and end product and a technical spec for coding blocs 

I am open to comment and pitches on how to structure coding each phase of the project but the aim is 'Artwork ready for May 1'.

A rediculously tight schedule but all those interested in teaming up working directly on the website or meet up London, please contact either via @def-articl or @itles (NodeGirls)

The project is set up with a wordpress framework and theme but all scripts / plugins / widgets are javascript (libraries), open source and editable 

Any comments please don't hesitate to contact. 

Thank you !
