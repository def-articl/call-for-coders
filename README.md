# call-for-coders

A Call for coders to work on a trans media artwork 

The project is A Social Network Portal 'Photzone' and  Media screen animation (frames)

The files include an abstract of the artwork and end product 
and a technical spec for coding blocs 
I am open to comment and pitches on how to structure coding each phase of the project but the aim is 'Artwork ready for MAy 1'
A rediculously tight schedule but all those interested in teaming up working directly on the website or meet up London please contact either via @def-articl or @itles (NodeGirls)

The project is set up with a wordpress framework and theme but all scripts / plugins / widgets are javascript (libraries), open source and editable 

Any comments please don't hesitate to contact. 

Thank you !
